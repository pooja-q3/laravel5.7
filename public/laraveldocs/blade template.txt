I am starting to learn laravel and saw two ways to return a view.

1. return View::make('login');
2. return view('login');

They both do the same, first one is through the use of Facade's The second one is a helper method.

Doesn't matter which one you use, just choose the syntax you prefer.

-----------------------------
All views in Laravel are usually built in the blade template.  Blade engine is fast in rendering views because it caches the view until they are modified. 
All the files in resources/views have the extension .blade.php.

Laravel blade template is pretty impressive in performance.


Blade allows the use of the layout that I just created by using @extends. By creating @section, I will create a section that will be used in the layout. 
Here I will use @section(‘content’) and in the layout, everything that I will type here will be injected in @yield in the layout.
