Facades provide a "static" interface to classes that are available in the application's service container.
 Laravel ships with many facades which provide access to almost all of Laravel's features

All of Laravel's facades are defined in the Illuminate\Support\Facades namespace. So, we can easily access a facade like so:

Facades Vs. Dependency Injection

use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Cache;

Route::get('/cache', function () {
    return Cache::get('key');
});

We can write the following test to verify that the Cache::get method was called with the argument we expected:

use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Cache;

public function testBasicExample()
{
    Cache::shouldReceive('get')
         ->with('key')
         ->andReturn('value');

    $this->visit('/cache')
         ->see('value');
}
